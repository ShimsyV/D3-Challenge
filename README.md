Welcome to the newsroom! I've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. I am tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.  The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### D3 Dabbler

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty .

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. This code is in the app.js file â€”  pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. The scatter plot should ultimately appear like the following.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.


* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.


Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
